          <h3>A Cause to "Beelieve" In</h3>
          <p>
            We are the <em>only</em> non-profit that offers grants and funding
            for scientific research focused on bee conservation. NSBP is run by
            volunteers and <strong>100%</strong> of donations go towards
            education, research, and community programs.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "After federal funding decreased at my lab, a colleague told me
            about the NSBP. I applied and was approved for a research grant
            within three months. If not for the funding from NSBP my work and my
            lab would have been shut down."

          <p>
            The NSBP got its start in 1969 when founders Tommy and Mark met and
            became friends at Woodstock Music Festival. They discovered a mutual
            passion for bees and beekeeping and decided to start a non-profit to
            help spread awareness and education in an effort to protect the
            craft.
            <q>We just had an immediate connection over our love for bees!</q>
            said Mark about their humble beeginnings. Since then, our efforts
            have grown from beekeeping to scientific research and preservation.
